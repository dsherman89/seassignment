App deployed on https://seassignment.onrender.com

Normally passwords would not be put here due to security but for this app. Test users are...

Username: admin11
Password: adminpass

Username: user1
Password: user1pass

Please note, when logging in, the admin route will not work right now as the roles table is not hooked up to my user table therefore the users roles will always return 'undefined'. This is something for fixing.

Alternatively, to run locally:

Pull the code from this repo
Go to a terminal and navigate to the folder where the code is, specifically app.js
Run command 'node app.js'
Navigate to a browser and go to 'localhost:3000'
